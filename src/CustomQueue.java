/**
 * A hand-written singly linked FIFO (first in, first out) queue of bookings.

 * This class exists to show the data structure itself, so it does not use any
 * class from the Java collections framework. Bookings leave the queue in the
 * same order they joined it: the customer who has waited longest is served
 * first.
 *
 * The queue keeps two pointers. {@code front} is the node that will be removed
 * next and {@code rear} is the last node, whose {@code next} is always null.
 * Keeping both means enqueue and dequeue are both O(1). The {@code size} field
 * is kept in step with the pointers so callers do not have to walk the list.
